# Mouse

Since the hackatime tracking for github is unrelable, I will be journalling my process in addition to tracking my time using hackatime. Currently, hackatime shows 2h 59m on the clock, with 23 minutes spent on the mouse project so far.

Hackatime showing today's time spent on the mouse design. Note that the dates on hackatime are unreliable, as this date should really show July 29th. 

## 3:30 or so. 
Finished making the outline for the base of the mouse. It took me SO long to figure out why fusion 360 wouldnt see the geometry of the mouse base that i imported from the onshape document but i eventually got it working.

Got the rough design figured out- subject to change. Im going for a low-poly look.

## 7:25
Close to finishing the tutorial. I will probably make some small changes to personalize the mouse after finishing the tutorial.

## 7:38
Finished the tutorial. 

## 7:57 
Going to submit the design now. I added a number of alterations to make the mouse more comfortable to hold, and added a design on the top of the mouse case that makes it breathable too.

At this time, hackatime says I have logged 3h 18 minutes on fusion360 today designing the mouse.

Note how the date is still incorrect. Hackatime should show a value of this time or more when checked in the future.
