# Voronoi Mouse
A mouse with a voronoi design that also serves a dual purpose by making the mouse breathable (and hopefully more comfortable during long periods of use). I am not very good at 3d modelling ergonomic things- but I think this mouse turned out ok. 

## 3:30 or so. 
Finished making the outline for the base of the mouse. It took me SO long to figure out why fusion 360 wouldnt see the geometry of the mouse base that i imported from the onshape document but i eventually got it working.

Got the rough design figured out- subject to change. Im going for a low-poly look.

Close to finishing the tutorial. I will probably make some small changes to personalize the mouse after finishing the tutorial.

Finished the tutorial.

Going to submit the design now. I added a number of alterations to make the mouse more comfortable to hold, and added a design on the top of the mouse case that makes it breathable too.
