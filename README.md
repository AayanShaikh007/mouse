# Mouse

Since the hackatime tracking for github is unrelable, I will be journalling my process in addition to tracking my time using hackatime. Currently, hackatime shows 2h 59m on the clock, with 23 minutes spent on the mouse project so far.

Hackatime showing today's time spent on the mouse design. Note that the dates on hackatime are unreliable, as this date should really show July 29th. 

## Second entry- 3:30 or so. 
Finished making the outline for the base of the mouse. It took me SO long to figure out why fusion 360 wouldnt see the geometry of the mouse base that i imported from the onshape document but i eventually got it working.
